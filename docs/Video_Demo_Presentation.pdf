# AndroCompute Demo Script (5 minutes)

## Introduction (0:00-0:30)
"Hello, I'm Sule Bashir, and today I'm presenting AndroCompute - a distributed mobile compute network that turns Android devices into cloud compute nodes."

## Problem & Solution (0:30-1:30)
"Traditional cloud computing faces challenges of high costs and centralization. Meanwhile, billions of mobile devices remain underutilized. AndroCompute solves this by creating a decentralized network where Android devices contribute processing power."

## Technical Overview (1:30-2:30)
"Let me show you our system architecture. We have a coordinator server that manages job scheduling, Android workers that execute computations, and a real-time dashboard for monitoring."

## Live Demo (2:30-4:00)
"Now, let's see it in action. Here's our dashboard showing connected Android nodes. I'll submit a compute job... [submit job] And watch as it executes in real-time on the Android device... [show execution] The results are immediately available on the dashboard."

## Business Case & Conclusion (4:00-5:00)
"AndroCompute addresses a $50B+ edge computing market with significant cost advantages over traditional cloud providers. Our mobile-first approach and decentralized architecture position us uniquely in this growing space."
