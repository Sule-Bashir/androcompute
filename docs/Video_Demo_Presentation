AndroCompute Demo Script 
Introduction:
"Hello,I'm Sule Bashir,and today I'm presenting AndroCompute - a distributed mobile compute network that turns Android devices into cloud compute nodes."
Problem and Solution:
"Traditional cloud computing faces challenges of high costs and centralization. Meanwhile, billions of mobile devices remain underutilized. AndroCompute solves this by creating a decentralized network where Android devices contribute processing power."
Technical Overview:
"Let me show you our system architecture. We have a coordinator server that manages job scheduling, Android workers that execute computations, and a real-time dashboard for monitoring."
Live Demo:
"Now, let's see it in action. Here's our dashboard showing connected Android nodes. I'll submit a compute job.And watch as it executes in real-time on the Android device.The results are immediately available on the dashboard."
Business Case and Conclusion:
"AndroCompute addresses a $50B+ edge computing market with significant cost advantages over traditional cloud providers.Our mobile-first approach and decentralized architecture position us uniquely in this growing space."
Call to Action:
